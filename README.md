I am nine years of age and live at Mary Arden's Farm. I attend King's New School of Stratford-upon-Avon. My favourite lesson is Latin, however I have always quite enjoyed English Literature. My mother, Mary Arden, said I should start writing because of the creative stories I tell. In all honesty, they are pretty good. So I decided to start writing this diary and fill it with stories about school and home as well as my ideas. Who knows, maybe they will be worth something one day. Well, that's all for now. I am going with my father, John Shakespeare, to the workshop. He is a successful whittawer, or leather worker. Maybe, if father teaches me, I could be as good as him when I grow up. Fare thee well.](metadata/en-GB/images/phoneScreenshots/0%20Shakespeare's%20diary.png) |
