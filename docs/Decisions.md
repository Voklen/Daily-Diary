# Manually make settings page or use settings_ui

## Manual pros

- Less dependencies
- Can enforce using toDefault() through type checking
- Less code duplication

## settings_ui pros

- More likely to look good on iOS (but I'm not currently planning on releasing it there)

## Notes

- The UI will change when settings_ui updates. This can be a good thing (keeping in line with the latest material design standards) or a bad thing (UI constantly changing for not much reason)
